			In our multicultural society, people want to explore different cultures or reconnect with their own. saltï helps people achieve these goals in the best way possible - through food. Food is usually the first way people become interested in or learn about other cultures. Current recipe sites lack an authentic focus and traditional recipe sharing lacks accessibility. saltï provides a platform that allows people to share their homemade recipes and explore dishes reinterpreted around the globe. People can connect with other users for a cultural exchange in recipes and share pictures of their special dishes, whether it's their aunt's All-American Apple Pie, or their grand-aunt's German Apfelkuchen. saltï is for anyone who is interested in creating and sharing authentic dishes.
